Experiment:
need to determine what percentage of query time is spent doing the hash of the query item, vs scanning over potential collisions
AlphaMultiProbeLSH reduces the number of bands, which should reduce the hashing time, but it comes at the expense of more potential collisions
Need to see what kind of data dimension is needed before those start to outweight each other
-Is AlphLSH beneficial when you have really high dimensional data?

-check out image deduplication: there's usually one very close data point and then the rest are quite far away from the query point
